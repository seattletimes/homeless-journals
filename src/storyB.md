“**HOME IS A MATTER** of perspective; it’s where you’re at,” a guy named Monster tells me at an encampment close to Seattle’s freight harbor that has dozens of residents living in beaten-up old RVs and tents and that boasts genius power systems involving car batteries, cables and generators. 

Monster lives here with his partner and volunteers as an organizer and advocate for the community. He calls this location, which is sheltered from the rain by an overpass, “the perfect spot” because it’s not close to homeowners who might complain. 

Wherever you lay your hat is your home: If only it were that simple. 

If only flowers and fences could ease the constant threat of being swept from place to place.

If only the concern of reporters gave you immunity from the caprices of a gilded city with more construction cranes than any in America, and more brainpower than it knows what to do with, but that can’t figure out how to stop the mushrooming of shantytowns.

Seattle Mayor Ed Murray has deemed homelessness a civic emergency. But he and City Hall are under pressure to change their approach to it. Earlier this year, Murray  proposed, then scrapped a  controversial, five-year, $275 million property-tax levy to battle homelessness on multiple fronts. He now favors a countywide sales tax increase of 0.1 cents that could raise more money. 

Up until now, nothing — certainly not the clearing of encampments — seems to have eased the crisis. And considering the rising cost of living in a metropolitan area, housing and homeless advocates worry that even more people will be at risk.

In 2016 there were more than 4,500 “unsheltered” people sleeping in tents, in doorways, in green spaces, on benches, in cars, trucks and RVs, etc., a 19 percent increase over the previous year, according to the annual One Night Count survey by the Seattle/King County Coalition on Homelessness.

Several of the people who speak to us as we search for subjects for this story say they’ve figured out how to live this way long-term. 

If you were to ignore the semis rumbling frighteningly close to Will Ross’ immaculate space in a parking lot under an elevated roadway in Sodo, you’d swear you were in the home of a stylish neat freak. 

Ross, 66, who unlike many in this story agreed to use his full name, keeps the area spotless. His comfortable-looking bed is flawlessly made. 

In reality, the bed is a cocoon made up of six sleeping bags on a metal cot. “I lie on one and sleep in five,” he says. 

Ross says he’s done everything from painting and roofing to selling candy and cars and that he’s been homeless for 27 years.

“I’ve lived in a lot of automobiles and vans” in that time, he says over the scream of a train’s horn and the rumbling of diesel engines in the background. 

“I stayed in one car for 30 whole months,” Ross says.

Toiletries are kept at bedside. Hats, gloves, umbrellas and socks hang from a rack against a highway support pillar. Ross keeps a Bible by his cigarette lighter and ashtray but he hasn’t opened it yet. He says he’s afraid that if he starts to read it, the spirit might move him to reach out to his relatives back home in the Bay Area before he’s ready for that. He wants to have some dental work done and buy a car — get “situated” — before reconnecting.

Others we meet say   they’ve struggled to find work and housing after serving time in prison.

We hear that some women in the camps, who make up about a fifth of the population, pair up with men simply for the physical safety they can offer.

Many in the camps struggle with chemical dependencies, and a few appear to be high when we meet them. 

But others suffer from inadequately treated mental disorders and   traumas such as childhood or domestic abuse.

Some say their lives fell apart when they lost custody of their children, got evicted from a home, divorced a spouse or suffered from debilitating injuries that rendered them unable to work. 

A stunning number of the people we meet are well-educated, highly-skilled, hold down jobs or receive government financial aid, but still can’t afford to clear their debts or pay rent on an apartment.

A Mexican immigrant named Felix, who used to pick cherries and apples in Eastern Washington, breaks into tears when speaking in Spanish about his family’s tradition of artisan dollmaking and how he used to sell his own creations in Tijuana. 

A transplant from Arizona named Martes picks at his guitar for us at the tent he took over from a friend who managed to upgrade to an actual apartment recently. 

The 37-year-old works in construction but doesn’t tell his employers where he lives. He agrees to be photographed, but with his back to the camera. 

He hopes to springboard into more stable accommodations himself, if he can save enough money.
