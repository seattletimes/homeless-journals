        Pacific NW magazine invited residents of several homeless encampments in Seattle to share their personal stories, life lessons, frustrations and dreams based on their experiences living without permanent shelter. The resulting journal features their handwritten remarks, accompanied by black-and-white portraits that each person helped create. Here is a selection of pages from the journal.

      <p class="editors-note">
        The people who agreed to participate in this project, in most cases, lived in settings that lacked a space to comfortably and neatly write down their thoughts. Recognizing this, we have transcribed each of the journal entries.

        Local musician JD Cotton says he took inspiration from "Portraits of Homelessness" when writing his new song "<a href="https://jamesdeancotton.bandcamp.com/track/tiny-houses">Tiny Houses</a>," which he hopes will bring "a little more attention and understanding" to those without permanent shelter.
