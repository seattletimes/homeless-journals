“**THEY DON’T BUILD** mansions like this in Beverly Hills,” a man named Charles says as he greets visitors to an unofficial tent city beneath a tangle of highway overpasses in Seattle’s Sodo District.

It’s a cold, damp day and Charles warms himself by a smoldering campfire in a cluttered cul-de-sac of tents, bags of clothes and pots and pans, everything you need when you have no place else to live.

The locals here optimistically nicknamed this triangle of earth and puddles bordered by roads on three sides “The Field of Dreams.” But a stroll through the camp’s main drag of dirty rugs, soaked blankets, shoe-sucking mud and wooden pallets only reveals a boulevard of broken ones — theirs and ours.

What photographer Erika Schultz and I don’t realize on this first visit to “The Field” is that the city is about to evict dozens of  occupants of the camp due to safety concerns, including allegations of rape and prostitution, as well as the obvious public-health issues that come with people living outdoors among piles of garbage, heaps of personal possessions and intrepid rats.

On this day, the rodents scurry across the mud and under the pallets that separate many of the tents from the soggy ground.

In a matter of weeks, everyone we meet and everything we see here will be gone, swept out of sight at this location. But the gnawing crisis of homelessness will only have slogged to another patch of dirt or pavement in a perverse cycle of settling and uprooting.

At every turn, there are signs of what life must have been like before residents found themselves living alongside and under Seattle’s streets. 

A stuffed bear sits on a chair near one tent, a sight that wouldn’t be out of place in a child’s bedroom. People wave hello from rickety “porches” extending from the fronts of their dwellings.

One tent has been sectioned off by pallets stood on end to make a kind of yard — a figment of normalcy complete with a little potted plant that, despite the chill and seemingly in defiance of the bleak setting, bursts with yellow blossoms.

We’ve come to camps like “The Field” to profile this segment of the region’s growing homeless community, a sliver of streetlife stretching from Seattle’s industrial district to the Interstate 90 highway interchange to the northern tip of Rainier Valley. 

Each person was invited to write whatever they wanted to express on a page that would be included in a journal capturing this moment in the story of homelessness in Seattle. We photographed each writer and invited them to help select which portrait to use. 

The perseverance, pride and ambition reflected in the 22 subjects who agreed to participate, in the poses in which they chose to be photographed and in the messages and reflections they wrote, remind us of people’s capacity to wrench dignity from the seeming indecency of homelessness. 

“They say I’m homeless. I say I’m a Seattle friend. Get II know me,” the 38-year-old Charles writes in flamboyant script in his journal entry. 

An animator, radio DJ, recording artist, actor and father, Charles says he doesn’t want pity, and he doesn’t like the word “homeless.” He prefers “displaced.”

“That word ‘homeless’ — it’s crippling,” he says. 

But what to make of the situation in which we encountered these most marginalized of our neighbors, people who’ve somehow made a life and in some cases forged community in places that lack running water, safe heating or a clear way out?
