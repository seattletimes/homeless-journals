“**ARE YOU HUNGRY** — do you want a sandwich?” someone calls out to us.

Veronica Jackson stands at the entrance to a camp along South Dearborn Street with a crate full of sandwiches that she and several cousins made earlier that day. 

She and her group move tent to tent asking if anybody’s home and if they’re hungry.

Jackson, who lives in Federal Way and who is without a permanent home herself, decided one day last year she would use her own money to help feed the homeless.

For Jackson, 28, this is personal. Her mom used to live on these streets, she explains, as tears stream down her face. 

Showing residents of the camps just a little generosity and humanity goes a long way, she says. So she decided to come back this year.

Jackson took $100 of her savings and turned it into 80 sandwiches. Each person who accepts a sandwich gets a prayer and maybe a hug if they need it.

At a camp along Interstate 90 east of “The Field,” a couple named Leo and Marie help lead a cleanup project to keep their area litter-free. They got an assist from a nearby homeowner, Mark Lloyd, who takes us through the camp to show the good work residents are doing to keep it tidy. Lloyd donated rakes, shovels garbage cans and bags, and even a set of privacy tents outfitted with portable toilets that dot the property. 

Marie says they don’t work so hard on the cleanup just for the residents. It’s also for their dogs, 2 Paw and Biggie, so they don’t pick up any carelessly strewn drug needles.

As they pose for pictures by their tent, Marie and Leo cradle the dogs in their arms, seemingly unfazed by the fact that this idyllic domestic scene plays out as commuters race by so close you can feel the rush of air in their wake.

A couple of days before “The Field” is cleared of its residents, we meet   Rico, whose fiancee gave birth to a boy a few days before. The proud father still wears the hospital ID badge around his neck after spending the night there with the newborn.

Walking through the camp, I hear the coos of someone else’s baby in a tent with a stroller in front of it. 

Rico met his fiancee here, and as a Jack of all trades he helps out by offering to fix bikes and repair tents  for his neighbors. But he knows this is no place to raise their own child. 

A transplant from Texas, Rico says he got laid off from his job as a heavy-machine operator in 2015. Enticed by the strong economy, he moved to Seattle the next year and lived in a motel for two months before moving into The Field where he’d be able to save money more easily. He was making payments to a friend for a car the friend owns but when the little work he was able to get dried up, that planned stalled. 

Rico says he lost steam and  got lazy. 

In desperate times, it’s easy to be drawn into a life of hustling  and just give up on getting out, as some do.  Rico says he’s resisted doing anything illegal but the listnessness has been  harder to fight. 

Rico figures that the birth of his son coinciding with the  sweep of the camp is a sign.

“He’s the motivation I needed to get up off my butt,” he says.

Instead of staring into the abyss, Rico’s eyes are fixed on the future.
